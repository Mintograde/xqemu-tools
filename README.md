## Quickstart

- Start xemu with `-s -qmp tcp:localhost:4444,server,nowait`
- Run `python3 halo_basic_stat.py`

## Notes

Just dumping some early 2019 experiments based on JayFox/xbox7887/Cyrix's stuff

`halo_basic_stat.py` starts a websocket server for live data, which can be read by halospawns-live branch.

Most of the requirements/imports are not required...
