TODO:
    For guest pointers, cache guest virtual addresses and their host physical counterparts, then check them externally for changes every time (from host memory).
    If address changes, grab new guest virtual / host physical pair and replace in cache.
    (with the goal of catching and correcting changes in allocated memory regions, or in guest dynamic addresses)
